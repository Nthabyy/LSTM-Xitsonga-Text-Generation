# Xitsonga Text Generation using LSTM Architecture

## Problem Statement

In this project, we aim to develop a **text generation model** for the **Xitsonga** language using the **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** architecture. The model will generate text based on a corpus scraped from the **Sadiler website**, which contains a rich collection of Xitsonga linguistic content. The model will learn language patterns from this dataset to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences in Xitsonga.

## Key Steps in the Process

### 1. **Data Collection**

The first step is to collect the text data. The corpus for training was collected from Sadiler website, which provides a variety of Xitsonga textual content. The data collection process involves extracting text from the government websites.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**

Once the text data is collected, it is important to clean it to ensure that it is ready for processing. The following cleaning steps are applied:
- **Removing Numbers**: Numbers are removed as they do not contribute meaningfully to text generation.
- **Removing Special Characters and Hashtags**: Special characters, punctuation marks, and hashtags are removed to focus on words.
- **Converting to Lowercase**: All text is converted to lowercase to standardize the data and avoid redundancy.
- **Whitespace Removal**: Extra spaces between words are eliminated to ensure uniform text formatting.

These cleaning procedures help remove noise from the data and prepare it for the next stages of preprocessing.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Before proceeding with model building, it is important to explore the dataset and understand its structure. EDA helps us uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data. Some of the common visualizations used in this step include:
- **Word Frequency Distribution**: Visualizing the most frequent words in the dataset helps us understand the content.
- **Sentence Length Distribution**: This helps to assess the length of sentences and decide on a maximum sequence length.

EDA provides insights into the text and assists in preparing the data for tokenization and model training.

### 4. **Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing involves preparing the raw text for the model by converting it into a format suitable for LSTM-based training. The key steps in preprocessing are:
- **Tokenization**: The text is split into tokens (words), and each word is mapped to a unique integer using a tokenizer.
- **Sequence Creation**: Sequences of tokens are created to represent context for the model. 
- **Padding**: Sequences are padded to ensure they all have the same length. Padding ensures that shorter sequences are extended with zeros to maintain uniformity.


### 5. **Model Building**

The architecture of the model includes the following components:
- **Embedding Layer**: The input sequences are transformed into dense vectors in an embedding space.
- **LSTM Layer**: The LSTM layer learns the temporal dependencies in the text.
- **Dropout Layers**: Dropout is used to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.
- **Dense Layer**: A dense layer with a softmax activation function is used to predict the next word in the sequence.

The model is built using **Keras** with **TensorFlow** as the backend. The LSTM architecture is chosen for its ability to capture long-range dependencies in text, which is crucial for generating coherent sentences.

### 6. **Model Training**

The model is trained using the preprocessed data. During training, the model learns to predict the next word in the sequence based on the context provided by previous words. The following steps are involved in training:
- **Split the Data**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets in an 80-10-10%.
- **Compile the Model**: The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer (Adam) and a loss function (categorical crossentropy).
- **Train the Model**: The model is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set.

### 7. **Text Generation**

After the model is trained, it can be used for generating text. The text generation process involves:
- **Temperature-Controlled Sampling**: Temperature was used to control the randomness of predictions. A higher temperature generates more diverse text, while a lower temperature results in more predictable output.
- **Seed Text**: A seed text is provided to start the generation process. The model generates the next word based on the seed and continues generating words iteratively to form a sentence or paragraph.

### Example:

- **Seed Text**: "Ndzi vona swifaniso swa rixaka ra mina, leswi nga kumekaka emahlweni ka malembe."

Based on this seed, the model will start by predicting the next word and continue iteratively. The generated text might look like this:

- **Generated Text**: "Ndzi vona swifaniso swa rixaka ra mina, leswi nga kumekaka emahlweni ka malembe. Hikwalaho ka leswi, vanhu va ri karhi va hlangana tanihi swakudya leswi tsakisaka."
- 
### 8. **Model Evaluation**

Model evaluation is performed to assess how well the model generates text. The evaluation process includes:
- **Loss and Perplexity**: Loss measures how well the model is fitting the data, while perplexity gives an indication of how well the model predicts the next word.

## Conclusion

In this project, we developed a text generation model for the **Xitsonga** language using the **LSTM architecture**. By following the steps of data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and model building, we trained a model that can generate contextually relevant Xitsonga text. Advanced techniques like **temperature-controlled sampling** were used to improve the coherence of the generated text. The model can be used for various applications, such as creating conversational agents or generating linguistic content in Xitsonga.
